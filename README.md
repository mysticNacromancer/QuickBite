# QuickBite
"At Sinhgad Lonavala campus, dining options are limited, and long canteen lines waste time, especially on weekends when the mess is closed. QuickBite lets students order and pay from their hostel, avoiding crowded lines. Once the food is prepared, they receive a notification to pick it up, making dining quicker, easier, and stress-free."
